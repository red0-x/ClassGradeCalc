### ü§ì red0-x/ClassGradeCalc üñ© - The Google Classroom Grade Calculator 
 Adds all of your Google Classroom grades together to give a letter grade
 - I made this because my school grades everything in the classroom and only announces the grades quarterly; I don't want to fall behind :)
 - ‚ö†Ô∏è Use with caution, scraping Google is AGAINST their tos.
 - Ô∏èÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏è It's possible your Google account could get banned, and you might get in trouble with your school! ‚ö†

### Usage: 
 - clone repo & create virtual environment 

 ``$> git clone https://github.com/red0-x/ClassGradeCalc.git && python3 -m venv .venv``
 
 - activate virtual environment 
 
 ``$> source .venv/bin/activate``
 
 - head to root dir and install modules
 
 ``$> cd main && pip install -r requirements.txt``
 
 - Not sure if this works on Windows, but for Linux, you need to install geckodriver and Firefox. 
 
 - Check --> https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases and add to usr/bin
 
 - You will probably run into many problems while installing this. 
 ### ‚ÄºÔ∏è You NEED to create a Firefox profile called "dev-classroom" 
 ###### You can do so by typing firefox -p to create the new profile 
 ###### after that, you need to login to classroom.google.com with the googe account you want to scrape. 
 ###### The bot should use the profile that is already logged in, and you're good!
 - Once set up simply start scraping grades.
